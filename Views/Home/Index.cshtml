                    Prior to entering the field of technology, I dedicated five years to esthetics and the beauty industry. While I found the work enjoyable, I needed a deeper sense of fulfillment. The transition to becoming a developer, thanks to Centriq, has been transformative and inspiring.
                    <br /> <br />
                    My fascination with coding quickly evolved from a passing interest to a true passion. The skills I attained as an esthetician, including managing the needs of over 20 clients daily, honing effective communication, and becoming adept at problem-solving, have been invaluable.
                    <br /> <br />
                    Now, having graduated from Centriq, I'm ecstatic about expanding my expertise in various coding languages and crafting exciting projects. The boundless potential of this field is incredible, and I can't wait to collaborate on a team with nerds like me. Thank you for visiting my site, and please feel free to reach out with any inquiries or simply to say hi!

                    @* <p>
                        Welcome to my site! a gal with a passion for crafting, gaming, and coding. My journey into the world of technology traces back to when I was a kid, where I found joy in gaming alongside my sisters and my dad, which later sparked an interest in coding. <br /><br />

                        As I've honed my skills at Centriq, coding has evolved from an interest to a genuine passion. I especially loved working with databases and . Another aspiration of mine is to develop a small indie game, with the hopes of expanding into something even bigger.<br /><br />

                        My journey into technology began after initially pursuing a path in the beauty industry, following in my mom's footsteps. This led me to become an esthetician at the age of 18 and pursue that role for 5 years. During my time in said role, I adeptly managed the needs of over 20 clients daily, refining my communication, problem-solving, and customer service skills. However, I felt limited creatively in this field, which spurred my decision to begin my education at Centriq.<br /><br />

                        My experiences have instilled in me a strong sense of adaptability, a trait in which I've learned is invaluable in the dynamic field of programming. I am a versatile and empathetic team player, and I'm ready to take on any challenge!<br /><br />

                        I'm excited about the endless possibilities of contributing my unique blend of creativity, technical skills, and passion to your team. Let's embark on a new adventure together and create something truly extraordinary!
